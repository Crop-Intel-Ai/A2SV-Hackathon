AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System: Use of  advanced AI and machine learning techniques to provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations. The system offers crop recommendations, early pest and disease detection, and weather-based planning through a user-friendly mobile and web application.


AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System

Project Overview:
--------------------

Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, but many farmers face challenges due to the lack of timely and accurate information. Issues such as incorrect crop choices, undetected pest infestations, and unpredictable weather patterns impact crop yields and farmers' livelihoods. Our AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System aims to solve these challenges by using advanced technology to provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations.

Purpose:
---------------
The purpose of this repository is to develop an AI-powered system that assists farmers by providing an efficient and accurate solution for their plant. Given the limited time and the complexity of the tasks, our team of five divided the work among three active members to ensure timely delivery. Despite the challenges, we successfully implemented key features, focusing on pest and plant disease detection. others are as follow:

Crop Recommendations:
--------------------------
Using machine learning models to recommend the best crops to plant based on soil and weather conditions.

Pest and Disease Detection:
-----------------------------

Implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect pest infestations early and prevent crop damage.

Weather-Based Planning:
------------------------
Providing accurate weather forecasts to help farmers plan their activities and optimize irrigation scheduling.

How It Solves the Problem
---------------------------
Timely Information:
---------------------
Farmers receive real-time recommendations and alerts through the mobile/web app, ensuring they make informed decisions.

Improved Crop Yields:
-----------------------
By choosing the right crops and detecting pests early, farmers can significantly improve their crop yields and reduce losses.

Sustainable Practices:
-----------------------
The system promotes sustainable farming by optimizing resource usage and reducing the reliance on harmful pesticides.
