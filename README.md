# A2SV-Hackathon
AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System: Use of  advanced AI and machine learning techniques to provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations. The system offers crop recommendations, early pest and disease detection, and weather-based planning through a user-friendly mobile and web application.


AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System

Project Overview:
--------------------

Agriculture is the backbone of our economy, but many farmers face challenges due to the lack of timely and accurate information. Issues such as incorrect crop choices, undetected pest infestations, and unpredictable weather patterns impact crop yields and farmers' livelihoods. Our AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System aims to solve these challenges by using advanced technology to provide farmers with actionable insights and recommendations.

Repository Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

Crop-Recommendation/: This directory contains the crop recommendation models and related files, which use machine learning techniques to suggest the best crops to plant based on various factors such as soil type, climate, and market demand.

Weather/: This directory includes the weather prediction and analysis tools, helping farmers plan their activities based on accurate weather forecasts. The tools are implemented using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web technologies.

Disease_Classification.ipynb: This file contains the notebook used for training and testing models that detect and classify plant diseases, helping farmers take preventive measures to protect their crops.

Datasets we are using for the Plant disease

Purpose:
---------------
The purpose of this repository is to develop an AI-powered system that assists farmers by providing an efficient and accurate solution for their plant. Given the limited time and the complexity of the tasks, our team of three divided the work among three members to ensure timely delivery. Despite the challenges, we successfully implemented key features, focusing on weather and crop recommendation an a little on Plant disease. others are as follow:



How AI Models are Solving the Problem
----------------------------------------
The AI-Powered Agricultural Advisory System leverages machine learning models to enhance the platform's functionality:

Crop Recommendation: 
----------------------
The system uses models trained on diverse datasets to recommend the most suitable crops based on local conditions and historical data. This helps farmers make informed decisions that can maximize their yield and profit.

Pest and Disease Detection: 
--------------------------------
By analyzing images of crops, the system can detect early signs of pest infestations or diseases. This allows farmers to take timely action, reducing the risk of crop loss.

Weather-Based Planning:
--------------------------
The platform incorporates weather prediction models to help farmers plan their activities around expected weather conditions. This includes planting schedules, irrigation planning, and harvest timing.
